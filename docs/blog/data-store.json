Vocalis Studio provides tools to help you manage your growing collection of recordings.\n\nThe recording list gives you quick access to playback, sorting, filtering, and analysis features. In this guide, I will explain how to use these tools effectively.\n\n## Summary\n\nManaging recordings in Vocalis Studio involves:\n\n1. Accessing the recording list from the home screen\n2. Using playback controls to review recordings\n3. Sorting and filtering to find specific recordings\n4. Renaming recordings for better organization\n5. Deleting recordings you no longer need\n\n## Accessing Your Recordings\n\nFrom the home screen, tap \"Recording List\" to view all your saved recordings. Each entry shows:\n\n- Recording title\n- Creation date and time\n- Duration\n- Scale type used (if any)\n\n![Recording List](/web/blog/images/en/03_recording_list_idle.png)\n\n## Playback Controls\n\nThe recording list includes playback controls for quick review:\n\n| Control | Function |\n|---------|----------|\n| Play/Pause | Start or pause playback |\n| Previous | Go to the previous recording |\n| Next | Go to the next recording |\n\nYou can listen to recordings directly from the list without opening the full analysis screen.\n\n![Recording List with Playback](/web/blog/images/en/03_recording_list_playback.png)\n\n## Sorting Options\n\nVocalis Studio offers 6 sorting options to organize your recordings:\n\n| Sort Option | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| Created (Newest) | Most recent recordings first (default) |\n| Created (Oldest) | Oldest recordings first |\n| Title (A-Z) | Alphabetical order |\n| Title (Z-A) | Reverse alphabetical order |\n| Duration (Shortest) | Shortest recordings first |\n| Duration (Longest) | Longest recordings first |\n\nTap the sort button to change the current sorting method. The default is \"Created (Newest)\" which shows your most recent recordings at the top.\n\n## Filtering Recordings\n\nWhen you have many recordings, filters help you find specific ones quickly.\n\n### Date Filter\n\n| Filter | Shows |\n|--------|-------|\n| All | All recordings |\n| Today | Recordings from today |\n| This Week | Recordings from this week |\n| This Month | Recordings from this month |\n\n### Scale Type Filter\n\nFilter by the scale pattern used during recording:\n\n- All (no filter)\n- Five Tone\n- Five Tone Down\n- Rossini Scale\n- Octave Repeat\n- Octave Long Tone\n- Broken Scale\n- Broken Scale Double\n- Arpeggio Down Triple\n- Free Recording (no scale)\n\n### Pitch Range Filter\n\nSet minimum and maximum pitch values to find recordings within a specific vocal range:\n\n- Minimum: C2 (MIDI note 36)\n- Maximum: C6 (MIDI note 84)\n\n### Tempo Range Filter\n\nFilter by tempo setting:\n\n- Minimum: 30 BPM\n- Maximum: 240 BPM\n\n### Text Search\n\nType keywords to search recording titles and settings. This is useful when you have named recordings with specific identifiers.\n\n## Renaming Recordings\n\nGive your recordings meaningful names to make them easier to find:\n\n1. Find the recording you want to rename\n2. Tap the edit option\n3. Enter a new name\n4. Confirm the change\n\nConsider using descriptive names like \"Warm-up Five Tone C4\" or \"High Range Practice\" to quickly identify recordings later.\n\n## Deleting Recordings\n\nTo remove recordings you no longer need:\n\n1. Select the recording to delete\n2. Tap the delete option\n3. Confirm deletion in the dialog\n\nNote that deleted recordings cannot be recovered. The app asks for confirmation before deleting to prevent accidental data loss.\n\n## Going to Analysis\n\nFrom any recording in the list, you can open the full analysis screen to see:\n\n- Pitch graph showing your performance over time\n- Spectrogram view of frequency content\n- Detailed statistics about accuracy and stability\n\n![Analysis Screen](/web/blog/images/en/04_analysis_idle.png)\n\nThe analysis screen provides deeper insights into each recording. See the pitch graph guide for more information about interpreting your analysis results.\n\n## Common Questions\n\n### Q: How many recordings can I save?\n\nRecordings are saved locally on your device. The limit depends on your device's available storage. Each recording uses minimal space, so you can typically save hundreds of recordings.\n\n### Q: Can I export my recordings?\n\nCurrently, recordings are stored locally within the app. Export functionality may be available in future updates.\n\n### Q: Why can I not find a recording?\n\nCheck your filter settings. If filters are active, some recordings may be hidden. Reset all filters to \"All\" to see your complete recording list.\n\n### Q: What happens if I delete the app?\n\nDeleting the app removes all stored recordings. Make sure to review any recordings you want to analyze before uninstalling.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Access recordings from the home screen\n- Use playback controls for quick review\n- Sort by date, title, or duration\n- Filter by date, scale type, pitch range, or tempo\n- Rename recordings for better organization\n- Delete unwanted recordings (with confirmation)\n- Open analysis screen for detailed insights\n\nWith these management tools, you can keep your recordings organized and easily track your progress over time.\n\n---\n\nWritten by: Vocalis Studio Developer","src/content/posts/en/manage-recordings.md","d0636cacf0e193b5",{"html":24,"metadata":25},"\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>After recording your voice, you will want to review your progress and keep your recordings organized.

Visually track how your voice compares to the target notes.",["Date","2025-12-18T10:00:00.000Z"],[18,102],"Analysis","## What is the Pitch Graph?\n\nIt's a visualization of how your pitch changes over time during a recording.\n\nWhen you open the analysis screen, this graph appears first. The horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents pitch. You can see at a glance how your voice moved throughout the recording.\n\n![Analysis Screen](/web/blog/images/en/04_analysis_idle.png)\n\n## What You Can Learn\n\n- Whether you're singing sharp or flat relative to the target\n- How stable your pitch is\n- Which notes are challenging for you\n\nWhen you record with a scale, target pitch lines are also displayed. Comparing your voice to these targets helps identify areas for improvement.\n\n## Reading the Graph\n\n### Basic Elements\n\nThe graph has two main elements.\n\n| Element | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Blue line | Your detected pitch (your voice) |\n| Faint horizontal lines | Target scale pitch lines |\n\nThe closer your voice is to the target line, the more accurate your pitch.\n\n![Pitch Graph (Fullscreen)](/web/blog/images/en/04_pitch_graph_fullscreen.png)\n\n### Axes\n\n- **Horizontal axis**: Represents the passage of time. Moves from left to right.\n- **Vertical axis**: Represents pitch. Higher notes are at the top, lower notes at the bottom.\n\n### Understanding Deviation\n\nIf your line is above the target line, you're singing sharp. If it's below, you're flat.\n\nIn my development experience, many users start by figuring out which direction they tend to deviate.\n\n## How to Navigate\n\nYou can interact with the graph using touch gestures.\n\n### Moving Through Time\n\nSwipe horizontally to move forward or backward in time. Even with long recordings, you can find the section you want to review.\n\n### Moving Through Pitch Range\n\nWhile playback is paused, swipe vertically to move the displayed pitch range up or down.\n\nThe swipe direction is automatically detected, so even diagonal movements will scroll in the intended direction.\n\n### Auto-Follow Mode\n\nDuring scale recording playback, the graph automatically follows the currently playing scale note position. You can toggle this on/off using the button within the graph.\n\nThis feature is only visible during playback.\n\n![Analysis Screen During Playback](/web/blog/images/en/04_analysis_playback.png)\n\n## Tips for Using the Graph\n\n### Start with the Big Picture\n\nRather than diving into details right away, first observe the overall pattern. Get a general sense of \"where things went off track.\"\n\n### Review the Same Sections Repeatedly\n\nOnce you identify challenging parts, record them multiple times and compare. Seeing your progress can be motivating.\n\n### Use with the Spectrogram\n\nThe analysis screen also has a \"Spectrogram\" tab. Use the pitch graph for pitch accuracy and the spectrogram for voice quality analysis—this gives you a more complete picture.\n\n## Summary\n\n- The pitch graph shows how pitch changes over time\n- Compare with target lines to assess accuracy\n- Swipe to navigate through time and pitch range\n- Start by observing overall trends\n\nNext time, we'll cover the basics of the spectrogram.\n\n---\n\nVocalis Studio Developer","src/content/posts/en/pitch-graph-guide.md","466476004e00a4d8",{"html":107,"metadata":108},"\u003Ch2 id=\"what-is-the-pitch-graph\">What is the Pitch Graph?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>It’s a visualization of how your pitch changes over time during a recording.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you open the analysis screen, this graph appears first.

Vocalis Studio makes this process simple and straightforward.\n\nAs the developer of this app, I designed the recording flow to be as intuitive as possible. You can start recording within seconds of opening the app.\n\nIn this guide, I will walk you through the basic recording process.\n\n## Summary\n\nMaking your first recording takes just three steps:\n\n1. Tap \"Start Recording\" on the home screen\n2. Set the scale type to \"Off\" for free recording\n3. Tap the record button to start, and tap again to stop\n\n## Basic Steps\n\n### Step 1: Open the Recording Screen\n\nFrom the home screen, tap the \"Start Recording\" button. This takes you to the recording screen where you can configure your recording settings.\n\n![Home Screen](/web/blog/images/en/01_home.png)\n\n### Step 2: Configure Settings (Optional)\n\nFor your first recording, I recommend keeping things simple:\n\n- **Scale Type**: Set to \"Off\" for free recording without a reference scale\n- **Other Settings**: You can leave these at their defaults for now\n\nThe settings panel is on the left side in landscape mode, or can be toggled in portrait mode.\n\n![Recording Screen - Ready to Record](/web/blog/images/en/02_recording_idle.png)\n\n### Step 3: Start Recording\n\nTap the red record button to begin. A brief countdown will appear, then recording starts automatically.\n\nWhile recording, you will see:\n\n- **Real-time waveform**: Visual representation of your voice\n- **Audio level meter**: Shows your current volume\n- **Pitch detection**: Displays the detected pitch in real-time\n\n![Recording in Progress](/web/blog/images/en/02_recording_in_progress.png)\n\nWhen you are finished, tap the stop button. Your recording is automatically saved.\n\n![Recording Complete](/web/blog/images/en/02_recording_complete.png)\n\n## What Happens After Recording\n\nOnce you stop recording, you have several options:\n\n- **Play Last Recording**: Listen to what you just recorded\n- **Go to Analysis**: View detailed pitch analysis and statistics\n- **Start New Recording**: Begin another recording session\n\n![Playback Mode](/web/blog/images/en/02_recording_playback.png)\n\nThe analysis screen provides valuable insights into your pitch accuracy and vocal characteristics.\n\n## Common Questions\n\n### Q: How long can I record?\n\nFree users can record up to 30 seconds per session, with 5 recordings per day. Premium subscribers have extended limits.\n\n### Q: Where are my recordings saved?\n\nAll recordings are saved locally on your device. You can access them from the \"Recording List\" on the home screen.\n\n### Q: Do I need headphones?\n\nHeadphones are recommended but not required. Using headphones can improve pitch detection accuracy by preventing feedback from the speaker.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Recording is simple: just tap and sing\n- Start with \"Scale Off\" mode for free recording\n- Real-time feedback helps you monitor your voice\n- Recordings are saved automatically for later review\n\nIn the next guide, we will explore how to use scale practice mode to improve your pitch accuracy.\n\n---\n\nWritten by: Vocalis Studio Developer","src/content/posts/en/first-recording.md","aced1082c6612491",{"html":171,"metadata":172},"\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Recording your voice is the first step toward understanding and improving your singing.

Configure your desired settings on the recording screen\n2. Tap the \"Save Preset\" button in the settings panel\n3. Enter a name and save\n\nChoose a descriptive name to find it easily later.\n\n## How to Load a Preset\n\n1. Tap \"Presets\" in the recording screen settings panel\n2.

Settings are applied automatically\n\n## Preset List Features\n\n### Sorting Options\n\nPresets can be sorted in three ways:\n\n| Sort | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| Last Updated | Most recently used at top (default) |\n| Name | Alphabetical order |\n| Pitch | By starting pitch (low to high) |\n\n### Edit and Delete\n\nYou can edit or delete any preset from the preset list.\n\n## Recommended Preset Examples\n\n### For Warm-ups\n\n- **Name**: \"Morning Warm-up\"\n- **Scale**: Five Tone\n- **Starting Pitch**: A comfortable low note (e.g., C3)\n- **Key Progression**: Ascending Then Descending\n- **Ascending Count**: 3\n\n### For High Note Training\n\n- **Name**: \"High Range Training\"\n- **Scale**: Octave Repeat\n- **Starting Pitch**: Mid-range note (e.g., E3)\n- **Key Progression**: Ascending Only\n- **Ascending Count**: 5-6\n\n### For Low Range Development\n\n- **Name**: \"Low Range Exercise\"\n- **Scale**: Five Tone Down\n- **Starting Pitch**: Mid-range note (e.g., G3)\n- **Key Progression**: Descending Only\n- **Descending Count**: 4\n\n### For Advanced Practice\n\n- **Name**: \"Full Range Workout\"\n- **Scale**: Rossini Scale\n- **Starting Pitch**: Low note (e.g., C3)\n- **Key Progression**: Ascending Only\n- **Ascending Count**: 6-8\n\n## Tips for Using Presets\n\n### Create a Practice Routine\n\nUse multiple presets in sequence to build a complete practice routine:\n\n1. \"Morning Warm-up\" to get your voice ready\n2. \"High Range Training\" to develop upper notes\n3. \"Low Range Exercise\" to maintain lower notes\n\n### Adjust Based on Daily Condition\n\nIf high notes feel difficult today, create a new preset with fewer ascending steps. Adjust presets as your voice changes and improves.\n\n### Use Descriptive Names\n\nInstead of \"C3 Start\", try \"Morning Warm-up Light\" - names that describe the purpose are more helpful.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Presets eliminate repetitive setup work\n- Scale type, pitch, key progression - everything is saved\n- Create purpose-specific presets to boost practice efficiency\n- Use clear, descriptive names for easy management\n- Combine multiple presets to build complete practice routines\n\n---\n\nVocalis Studio

Gradually challenge your high range, then cool down on the way back.\n\n### Descending Then Ascending\n\nGoes down first, then comes back up from the lowest point.\n\n**Example**: C4 → B3 → Bb3 → A3 → Bb3 → B3 → C4\n\nFor when you want to start from lower notes or add variety to your practice.\n\n## Key Change Settings\n\n### Ascending/Descending Count\n\nEach can be set from 0 to 24.\n\n| Setting | Default | Description |\n|---------|---------|-------------|\n| Ascending Count | 3 | Number of times to raise the key |\n| Descending Count | 0 | Number of times to lower the key |\n\nWith the default \"Ascending Then Descending\" pattern and 3 ascending steps, you'll perform 7 scales total (C→C#→D→D#→D→C#→C).\n\n### Step Interval\n\nSets how many semitones to change with each step.\n\n| Interval | Description | Example (ascending from C4) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------------------|\n| 1 (half step) | Default | C4 → C#4 → D4 |\n| 2 (whole step) | 2 semitones | C4 → D4 → E4 |\n| 3 (minor 3rd) | 3 semitones | C4 → D#4 → F#4 |\n| 12 (octave) | 1 octave | C4 → C5 → C6 |\n\n## Practical Setting Examples\n\n### For Beginners: Gentle Ascending\n\n- **Pattern**: Ascending Only\n- **Ascending Count**: 2-3\n- **Step**: 1 (half step)\n\nPerfect for gradually getting used to higher notes without strain.\n\n### Warm-up: Round Trip\n\n- **Pattern**: Ascending Then Descending\n- **Ascending Count**: 3\n- **Step**: 1 (half step)\n\nThe default setting works great. Perfect for starting your daily practice.\n\n### Range Extension: Wide Coverage\n\n- **Pattern**: Ascending Only\n- **Ascending Count**: 6-8\n- **Step**: 1 (half step)\n\nChallenge your high range limits.

A few simple adjustments can significantly improve detection accuracy.\n\n## Environment and Microphone Position Matter\n\nYou don't need special equipment—just optimizing your environment can improve recording quality.\n\n## Microphone Distance\n\nWhen using your iPhone or iPad's built-in microphone, distance is key.\n\n### Too Close\n\nIf the microphone is too close to your mouth, breath noise becomes prominent. Plosives (\"p\", \"t\" sounds) can also overload the microphone.\n\n### Too Far\n\nIf you're too far away, your voice becomes quiet and environmental sounds have more influence. This reduces pitch detection accuracy.\n\n### Recommended Distance\n\nAbout 20-30cm (8-12 inches) is a good guideline. Think about one to two palm-widths away.\n\n## Reducing Environmental Noise\n\n### Choose a Quiet Location\n\nAir conditioning, traffic, appliance noise—many sounds can affect your recording. Record in as quiet a place as possible.\n\n### Rooms with Less Reverb\n\nLarge rooms or rooms with hard walls create more echo. Curtains and fabric help reduce reverb.\n\nA closet—small and surrounded by clothes—can actually be a great recording spot.\n\n### Use Earphones\n\nScale sounds from speakers can interfere with pitch detection. Using earphones ensures only your voice is recorded.\n\n## Adjusting Detection Sensitivity\n\nYou can adjust pitch detection sensitivity in the settings.\n\n| Setting | Characteristics | Best For |\n|---------|-----------------|----------|\n| Low | Noise resistant | Noisy environments |\n| Normal | Balanced | General use |\n| High | Detects quiet sounds | Quiet environments, soft singing |\n\nAdjust according to your environment. Use \"Low\" in noisy conditions, \"High\" when practicing quietly in a silent space.\n\n## Other Tips\n\n### Keep Volume Consistent\n\nExtremely loud or soft voices can cause unstable detection. Record at your normal singing volume.\n\n### Warm Up First\n\nYour pitch tends to be unstable when your voice isn't warmed up. Light humming before recording leads to more accurate analysis.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Aim for 20-30cm microphone distance\n- Choose a quiet location with minimal reverb\n- Use earphones to prevent scale sound interference\n- Adjust detection sensitivity for your environment\n- Keep volume consistent and warm up before recording\n\n---\n\nVocalis Studio Developer","src/content/posts/en/recording-tips.md","e2eb69ce143b0f89",{"html":482,"metadata":483},"\u003Ch2 id=\"what-makes-a-good-recording\">What Makes a Good Recording\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Pitch detection accuracy depends heavily on recording quality.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Too much noise or too low a volume makes accurate analysis difficult.

By singing along with reference tones, you can train your ear and voice to hit the right notes consistently.\n\nVocalis Studio provides various scale patterns designed for vocal training. Each pattern serves a different purpose, from basic warm-ups to advanced exercises.\n\nIn this guide, I will explain how to set up and use scale practice mode.\n\n## Summary\n\nScale practice in Vocalis Studio works like this:\n\n1. Choose a scale pattern (9 types available)\n2. Set your starting pitch (C3 to C6)\n3. Adjust the tempo if needed\n4. Record while following the reference tones\n\n## Understanding Scale Types\n\nVocalis Studio offers 9 scale patterns:\n\n| Scale Type | Description | Best For |\n|------------|-------------|----------|\n| Five Tone | Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-Fa-Mi-Re-Do | Basic warm-up, beginners |\n| Five Tone Down | So-Fa-Mi-Re-Do (descending) | Descending practice |\n| Octave Repeat | Climb to octave, repeat top note | Sustaining high notes |\n| Octave Long Tone | Hold the octave for 4 beats | Breath control |\n| Broken Scale | 1-5-3-8-5-3-1 pattern | Interval jumps |\n| Broken Scale Double | Above pattern repeated twice | Extended practice |\n| Rossini Scale | 1.5 octave ascending scale | Range extension |\n| Arpeggio Down Triple | 16-note descending arpeggio | Advanced agility |\n\nFor beginners, I recommend starting with **Five Tone**. It covers a comfortable range and follows a familiar pattern.\n\n## Setting Up Your Practice\n\n### Starting Pitch\n\nThe starting pitch determines where your scale begins. You can set it anywhere from C3 to C6 (MIDI notes 48-84).\n\nTips for choosing your starting pitch:\n\n- **Start in your comfortable range**: Choose a pitch where you can sing easily\n- **Adjust based on the scale**: Higher scales need a lower starting pitch\n- **Consider the scale's range**: Five Tone spans 7 semitones from the start\n\n### Tempo\n\nTempo controls how long each note is held. The range is 1.0 to 3.0 seconds per note.\n\n- **1.0 second**: Standard tempo, good for most practice\n- **2.0+ seconds**: Slower pace, useful for breath control and sustained tones\n- **Faster than 1.0**: Not available, as accurate pitch requires time to settle\n\n### Key Progression\n\nKey progression determines how the scale moves through different keys:\n\n| Pattern | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Ascending Only | Move up by semitones |\n| Descending Only | Move down by semitones |\n| Ascending Then Descending | Go up, then come back down |\n| Descending Then Ascending | Go down, then come back up |\n\nYou can also set:\n\n- **Ascending Key Count**: How many keys to move up (0-24)\n- **Descending Key Count**: How many keys to move down (0-24)\n- **Step Interval**: How many semitones per step (1-12)\n\n![Recording Screen with Scale Settings](/web/blog/images/en/02_recording_idle.png)\n\n## During Practice\n\nWhen you start recording with a scale:\n\n1. **Chord introduction**: You hear a chord to establish the key\n2. **Scale playback**: Reference tones play one by one\n3. **Real-time feedback**: The app shows your pitch against the target\n\n![Scale Practice in Progress](/web/blog/images/en/02_recording_in_progress.png)\n\nThe indicator display shows:\n\n- **Target note**: The note you should be singing\n- **Detected note**: What the app hears from you\n- **Cent deviation**: How far off you are (±50 cents)\n\n## Saving Presets\n\nIf you find settings that work well for you, save them as a preset:\n\n1. Configure your preferred settings\n2. Tap the save preset button\n3. Give your preset a name\n\nYou can manage presets from the preset list, including renaming and deleting.\n\n## Common Questions\n\n### Q: Which scale should I start with?\n\nFive Tone is ideal for beginners. It covers a comfortable range and the pattern is intuitive.\n\n### Q: How do I know if I am singing in tune?\n\nWatch the indicator display. When your detected pitch matches the target, the display will show minimal cent deviation (close to 0).\n\n### Q: Can I practice without the reference tones?\n\nYes, set the scale type to \"Off\" for free recording.

キー進行とは\n\nスケールを1回演奏した後、自動的にキー（調）を変えて次のスケールを演奏する機能です。\n\n![録音画面のキー進行設定](/images/ja/02_recording_idle.png)\n\nたとえば、C4から始めて半音ずつ上げていくと、C4 → C#4 → D4 → D#4... と続きます。\n\nこれにより、一度の録音で複数のキーを効率的に練習できます。\n\n## 4つの進行パターン\n\n### 上昇のみ（Ascending Only）\n\nキーが上がっていくだけのパターンです。\n\n**例**: C4 → C#4 → D4 → D#4（3回上昇の場合）\n\n高音域を少しずつ広げていく練習に最適です。\n\n### 下降のみ（Descending Only）\n\nキーが下がっていくだけのパターンです。\n\n**例**: C4 → B3 → Bb3 → A3（3回下降の場合）\n\n低音域の開発や、リラックスした発声練習に向いています。\n\n### 上昇→下降（Ascending Then Descending）\n\nまず上昇し、最高点から下降するパターンです。**デフォルト設定**です。\n\n**例**: C4 → C#4 → D4 → D#4 → D4 → C#4 → C4\n\nウォームアップに理想的。徐々に高音域に挑戦し、クールダウンしながら戻ってきます。\n\n### 下降→上昇（Descending Then Ascending）\n\nまず下降し、最低点から上昇するパターンです。\n\n**例**: C4 → B3 → Bb3 → A3 → Bb3 → B3 → C4\n\n低音域から始めたい場合や、変化をつけた練習に。\n\n## キー変更の設定項目\n\n### 上昇回数・下降回数\n\nそれぞれ0〜24回まで設定できます。\n\n| 設定 | デフォルト | 説明 |\n|------|-----------|------|\n| 上昇回数 | 3回 | キーを上げる回数 |\n| 下降回数 | 0回 | キーを下げる回数 |\n\nデフォルトでは「上昇→下降」パターンで上昇3回なので、計7回のスケール演奏になります（C→C#→D→D#→D→C#→C）。\n\n### ステップ間隔\n\nキーをいくつずつ変えるかを設定します。\n\n| 間隔 | 説明 | 例（C4から上昇） |\n|------|------|------------------|\n| 1（半音） | デフォルト | C4 → C#4 → D4 |\n| 2（全音） | 2半音ずつ | C4 → D4 → E4 |\n| 3（短3度） | 3半音ずつ | C4 → D#4 → F#4 |\n| 12（オクターブ） | 1オクターブずつ | C4 → C5 → C6 |\n\n## 実践的な設定例\n\n### 初心者向け：ゆるやかな上昇\n\n- **パターン**: 上昇のみ\n- **上昇回数**: 2〜3回\n- **ステップ**:

名前を変える\n\n録音にわかりやすい名前を付けておくと、後から探しやすくなります。\n\n1. 変更したい録音を選ぶ\n2. 編集をタップ\n3. 新しい名前を入力\n4. 保存\n\n「朝練習 C4」「高音チャレンジ」など、自分がわかる名前を付けましょう。\n\n## 削除する\n\n不要な録音を消すには：\n\n1. 削除したい録音を選ぶ\n2. 削除をタップ\n3. 確認ダイアログでOK\n\n一度削除した録音は復元できません。確認ダイアログが出るので、間違えて消す心配は少ないです。\n\n## 分析画面へ\n\n一覧から録音を選ぶと、詳細な分析画面を開けます。\n\n- ピッチグラフ\n- スペクトログラム\n- 統計情報\n\n![分析画面](/web/blog/images/ja/04_analysis_idle.png)\n\n練習の振り返りに活用してください。\n\n## Q&A\n\n### 録音は何件まで保存できる？\n\nデバイスの容量次第です。1件あたりのデータ量は小さいので、数百件は問題なく保存できます。\n\n### 録音をエクスポートしたい\n\n現時点ではアプリ内保存のみです。将来のアップデートで対応する可能性があります。\n\n### 録音が見つからない\n\nフィルターが有効になっているかもしれません。すべてのフィルターを「すべて」に戻すと、全録音が表示されます。\n\n### アプリを消すとデータは？\n\nアプリを削除すると、録音データもすべて消えます。ご注意ください。\n\n## まとめ\n\n- 録音一覧はホーム画面からアクセス\n- 再生コントロールですぐに聴ける\n- 並べ替えとフィルターで整理\n- わかりやすい名前を付けると便利\n- 削除は確認付きで安心\n- 詳しい分析は分析画面で\n\n録音を整理しておくと、上達の過程が見えやすくなります。\n\n---\n\nVocalis Studio

スケール練習とは\n\nスケール練習は、ピッチ（音程）を正確に出すための基本トレーニングです。\n\nアプリが鳴らすガイド音に合わせて歌うことで、「この音はこの高さ」という感覚が身についていきます。耳と声の連携を鍛える、シンプルで効果的な方法です。\n\n## 基本の流れ\n\n1. スケールパターンを選ぶ（9種類）\n2. 開始ピッチを決める（C3〜C6）\n3. テンポを調整（必要に応じて）\n4. ガイド音に合わせて録音\n\n## スケールの種類\n\nVocalis Studioには9つのスケールパターンがあります。\n\n| スケール | パターン | こんな人に |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| Five Tone | ドレミファソファミレド | 初心者、ウォームアップ |\n| Five Tone Down | ソファミレド | 下降の練習 |\n| Octave Repeat | オクターブまで上昇、頂点で繰り返し | 高音の持続 |\n| Octave Long Tone | オクターブを4拍キープ | ブレスコントロール |\n| Broken Scale | 1-5-3-8-5-3-1 | 跳躍のある音程 |\n| Broken Scale Double | 上記を2回 | 持久力アップ |\n| Rossini Scale | 1.5オクターブ上昇 | 音域拡張 |\n| Arpeggio Down Triple | 16音の下降アルペジオ | 上級者向け |\n\n迷ったら **Five Tone** からどうぞ。無理のない音域で、パターンも覚えやすいです。\n\n## 設定のポイント\n\n### 開始ピッチ\n\nスケールがどの音から始まるかを決めます。C3からC6まで設定可能です。\n\n選び方のコツ：\n\n- 楽に出せる音域から始める\n- 上に上がるスケールなら、低めからスタート\n- Five Toneは開始音から7半音の範囲を使います\n\n### テンポ\n\n1音あたりの長さを1.0〜3.0秒で設定します。\n\n- **1.0秒**: 標準。ほとんどの練習はこれでOK\n- **2.0秒以上**: ゆっくり。ロングトーンやブレス練習向け\n\n1.0秒より速い設定はできません。正確なピッチには、音を安定させる時間が必要だからです。\n\n### キー進行\n\n練習中にキーをどう移動させるかを決めます。\n\n| パターン | 動き |\n|---------|------|\n| 上昇のみ | 半音ずつ上がる |\n| 下降のみ | 半音ずつ下がる |\n| 上昇→下降 | 上がってから戻る |\n| 下降→上昇 | 下がってから戻る |\n\nさらに細かく設定できます：\n\n- **上昇キー回数**: 何キー上がるか（0〜24）\n- **下降キー回数**: 何キー下がるか（0〜24）\n- **ステップ間隔**: 1ステップで何半音動くか（1〜12）\n\n![録音画面（スケール設定）](/web/blog/images/ja/02_recording_idle.png)\n\n## 練習中の画面\n\n録音を始めると、次のように進みます。\n\n1. **コード導入**: キーを確立するコードが鳴る\n2. **スケール再生**: ガイド音が1音ずつ流れる\n3. **リアルタイム表示**: あなたのピッチと目標の比較\n\n![スケール練習中](/web/blog/images/ja/02_recording_in_progress.png)\n\nインジケーターには3つの情報が表示されます。\n\n- **目標ノート**: 今歌うべき音\n- **検出ノート**: アプリが拾っている音\n- **セント偏差**: どのくらいズレているか（±50セント）\n\n## プリセット保存\n\n気に入った設定の組み合わせは、プリセットとして保存できます。\n\n1. 設定を調整\n2. 保存ボタンをタップ\n3. 名前を付けて保存\n\n保存したプリセットは一覧から呼び出せます。名前の変更や削除も可能です。\n\n## Q&A\n\n### どのスケールから始めるべき？\n\nFive Toneがおすすめです。音域も狭く、パターンも直感的なので、スケール練習の入門に最適です。\n\n### 音程が合っているか、どう判断する？\n\nインジケーターを見てください。検出ピッチが目標と一致していれば、セント偏差が0に近づきます。\n\n### ガイド音なしで練習したい\n\nスケールタイプを「Off」にすればフリー録音になります。ただ、ガイド音を使うと音程の記憶が定着しやすいので、併用がおすすめです。\n\n## まとめ\n\n- スケール練習は音程トレーニングの基本\n- Five Toneから始めると無理がない\n- 開始ピッチは自分の声域に合わせて\n- テンポを遅くするとブレス練習にも\n- よく使う設定はプリセット保存\n\n次回は、録音の管理方法を紹介します。\n\n---\n\nVocalis Studio 開発者","src/content/posts/ja/scale-practice-intro.md","4f0dabd08860ef3f",{"html":1202,"metadata":1203},"\u003Ch2

良い録音とは\n\nピッチ検出の精度は、録音の品質に大きく左右されます。\n\nノイズが多かったり、音量が小さすぎたりすると、正確な分析が難しくなります。少しの工夫で、検出精度は大きく改善できます。\n\n## 環境とマイク位置が重要\n\n特別な機材がなくても、環境を整えるだけで録音品質は向上します。\n\n## マイク距離\n\niPhoneやiPadの内蔵マイクを使う場合、距離がポイントです。\n\n### 近すぎる場合\n\n口に近すぎると、息の音（ブレスノイズ）が入りやすくなります。破裂音（「ぱ」「た」など）でマイクが飽和することもあります。\n\n### 遠すぎる場合\n\n離れすぎると、声が小さくなり、環境音の影響を受けやすくなります。ピッチ検出の精度が落ちる原因になります。\n\n### おすすめの距離\n\n20〜30cm程度が目安です。手のひら1〜2枚分くらいの距離を意識してみてください。\n\n## 環境ノイズ対策\n\n### 静かな場所を選ぶ\n\nエアコンの音、外の車の音、家電のノイズなど、意外と多くの音が録音に影響します。なるべく静かな場所で録音しましょう。\n\n### 反響の少ない部屋\n\n広い部屋や壁が硬い部屋は、音が反響しやすくなります。カーテンや布があると反響が抑えられます。\n\nクローゼットの中など、狭くて布に囲まれた場所は意外と録音に向いています。\n\n### イヤホンの使用\n\nスピーカーから出るスケール音がマイクに入ると、ピッチ検出に影響することがあります。イヤホンを使うと、自分の声だけを録音できます。\n\n##

Studioには、さまざまな練習目的に対応した9種類のスケールパターンが用意されています。\n\n![録音画面のスケール設定](/images/ja/02_recording_idle.png)\n\nそれぞれの特徴と、どんな練習に向いているかを解説します。\n\n## 基本スケール\n\n### Five Tone（ファイブトーン）\n\n最も基本的なスケールパターンです。\n\n**構成**: ド→レ→ミ→ファ→ソ→ファ→ミ→レ→ド（9音）\n\n上昇してから下降する、馴染みのあるパターン。ウォームアップや基礎練習に最適です。\n\n**向いている練習**:\n- 毎日のウォームアップ\n- 音程感覚の確認\n- 初心者の基礎練習\n\n### Five Tone Down（ファイブトーン・ダウン）\n\n下降のみのシンプルなパターンです。\n\n**構成**: ソ→ファ→ミ→レ→ド（5音）\n\n高い音から始まるため、自然な声の流れで発声できます。\n\n**向いている練習**:\n- 下降フレーズの練習\n- リラックスした発声\n- 声の脱力トレーニング\n\n## オクターブスケール\n\n### Octave Repeat（オクターブ・リピート）\n\nトップノートを4回繰り返すパターンです。\n\n**構成**: ド→ミ→ソ→高ド→高ド→高ド→高ド→ソ→ミ→ド（10音）\n\n最高音を複数回歌うことで、高音域の安定性を鍛えられます。\n\n**向いている練習**:\n- 高音の安定化\n- ロングトーンの代替\n- 持久力トレーニング\n\n### Octave Long Tone（オクターブ・ロングトーン）\n\nオクターブ上で長く伸ばすパターンです。\n\n**構成**: ド→ミ→ソ→高ド（4拍ホールド）→ソ→ミ→ド\n\n最高音を長く保持することで、ブレスコントロールとピッチ維持力を同時に鍛えます。\n\n**向いている練習**:\n- ブレスコントロール\n- ピッチの安定性\n- ビブラートの練習\n\n## アルペジオ系スケール\n\n### Broken Scale（ブロークン・スケール）\n\n跳躍を含むアルペジオパターンです。\n\n**構成**: ド→ソ→ミ→高ド→ソ→ミ→ド（7音）\n\n音が飛ぶため、より正確な音程コントロールが求められます。\n\n**向いている練習**:\n- 音程の跳躍練習\n- 音程感覚の強化\n- 中級者のステップアップ\n\n### Broken Scale Double（ブロークン・スケール・ダブル）\n\nブロークンスケールを2回繰り返すパターンです。\n\n**構成**: ブロークンスケール × 2（13音）\n\nより長いフレーズで持久力と集中力を養います。\n\n**向いている練習**:\n- 長いフレーズの練習\n- スタミナ強化\n- 集中力トレーニング\n\n### Arpeggio Down Triple（アルペジオ・ダウン・トリプル）\n\n16音の長いアルペジオパターンです。\n\n下降アルペジオを3回繰り返す、本格的なボイストレーニング向けのパターン。\n\n**向いている練習**:\n- 本格的なボイストレーニング\n- 音域全体の均一化\n- 上級者の総合練習\n\n## 拡張スケール\n\n### Rossini Scale（ロッシーニ・スケール）\n\n1.5オクターブに及ぶ高度なスケールです。\n\n**構成**: 1オクターブ上昇後、さらに5度上まで到達してから下降（13音）\n\nオペラ歌手のトレーニングでも使われる本格的なパターン。高音域の開発に効果的です。\n\n**向いている練習**:\n- 音域の拡張\n- 高音域の開発\n- 上級者のチャレンジ\n\n## フリー録音\n\n### Off（スケールなし）\n\nスケール音なしで録音するモードです。\n\n自分のペースで自由に歌いたいとき、または曲のフレーズを練習したいときに使用します。\n\n**向いている練習**:\n- 曲のフレーズ練習\n- 自由な発声練習\n- リズムに縛られない練習\n\n## 目的別おすすめスケール\n\n| 練習目的 | おすすめスケール |\n|---------|----------------|\n| ウォームアップ | Five Tone |\n| 高音の安定 | Octave Repeat, Octave Long Tone |\n| 音程の正確さ | Broken Scale |\n| 音域拡張 | Rossini Scale |\n| 持久力 | Broken Scale Double, Arpeggio Down Triple |\n| リラックス | Five Tone Down |\n\n## スケール選びのヒント\n\n### 初心者の方\n\nまずは **Five Tone** から始めましょう。慣れてきたら **Octave Repeat** で少しずつ高音域に挑戦します。\n\n### 中級者の方\n\n**Broken Scale** で音程の跳躍に慣れ、**Octave Long Tone** でピッチの安定性を磨きましょう。\n\n### 上級者の方\n\n**Rossini Scale** や **Arpeggio Down Triple** で音域全体を均一に鍛えましょう。\n\n## まとめ\n\n- 基本は **Five Tone** でウォームアップ\n- 高音強化には **Octave** 系スケール\n- 音程精度には **Broken Scale**\n- 音域拡張には **Rossini Scale**\n- 練習目的に合わせてスケールを選ぶことが上達の近道\n\n---\n\nVocalis Studio 開発者","src/content/posts/ja/scale-types-guide.md","170faa6b5563300a",{"html":1357,"metadata":1358},"\u003Ch2

高い声、低い声の正体\n\n「声が高い」「声が低い」という表現は日常的に使います。では、この「高さ」とは何でしょうか。\n\n音の高さは、空気の振動の速さによって決まります。振動が速いほど高い音、遅いほど低い音として聞こえます。\n\n## 周波数が音の高さを決める\n\n音の高さを表す物理的な単位が「周波数」です。単位はHz（ヘルツ）。\n\n1秒間に空気が何回振動するかを表しています。たとえば440Hzなら、1秒間に440回振動している音です。\n\n### 基準となるA4 = 440Hz\n\n現在の国際標準では、ピアノの真ん中あたりにあるラの音（A4）を440Hzと定めています。\n\nこの音を基準に、他のすべての音の周波数が決まります。\n\n### オクターブと周波数\n\n1オクターブ上がると、周波数は2倍になります。\n\n| 音名 | 周波数 |\n|------|--------|\n| A3 | 220 Hz |\n| A4 | 440 Hz |\n| A5 | 880 Hz |\n\n逆に1オクターブ下がると、周波数は半分になります。\n\n## 音名とMIDI番号\n\n音の高さを表す方法は周波数だけではありません。\n\n### 音名（ドレミ、ABC）\n\n音楽では「ド・レ・ミ」や「C・D・E」といった音名で高さを表します。同じ音名でもオクターブが違えば、異なる高さになります。\n\nそのため「C4」「A4」のように、音名にオクターブ番号を付けて区別します。\n\n### MIDI番号\n\nコンピュータ音楽では、MIDI番号という0〜127の数値で音の高さを表します。\n\n| 音名 | MIDI番号 | 周波数 |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| C4（ミドルC） | 60 | 約262 Hz |\n| A4 | 69 | 440 Hz |\n| C5 | 72 | 約523 Hz |\n\nMIDI番号が1上がるごとに半音上がります。12上がると1オクターブです。\n\n## アプリでの表示\n\nVocalis Studioでは、検出したピッチを音名とセント偏差で表示しています。\n\nたとえば「A4 +5」なら、A4より5セント高い音が出ているという意味です。セントについては次の記事で詳しく解説します。\n\n## まとめ\n\n- 音の高さ（ピッチ）は周波数で決まる\n- 周波数の単位はHz（ヘルツ）\n- A4 = 440Hz が国際標準の基準音\n- 1オクターブ上がると周波数は2倍\n-
