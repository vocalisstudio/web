## What is Vocal Range?

Your vocal range is the span from the lowest note to the highest note you can produce comfortably.

Vocalis Studio supports MIDI notes 36 (C2) to 84 (C6). Understand your current range and expand it gradually.

## Assessing Your Current Range

First, accurately determine your current range.

### How to Assess

1. **Record with scale OFF**
2. Start low and gradually go higher
3. Note the comfortable range
4. Similarly, start high and go lower

### What to Record

- **Chest voice upper limit**: Highest note without strain
- **Falsetto upper limit**: Top of head voice
- **Low range limit**: Your lowest note
- **Comfortable range**: Where you sing stably

## Scale Settings for Range Extension

### Extending Low Range

Use **Five Tone Down**.

- **Scale**: Five Tone Down
- **Starting Key**: Mid-range
- **Key Progression**: Descending only
- **Progression Count**: 5-8
- **Tempo**: 60-70 BPM

The descending pattern naturally transitions to lower notes.

### Extending High Range

Start with **Five Tone**.

- **Scale**: Five Tone
- **Starting Key**: Comfortable range
- **Key Progression**: Ascending only
- **Progression Count**: 5-8
- **Tempo**: 70-80 BPM

### Both Directions

**Rossini Scale** is effective.

- **Scale**: Rossini Scale
- **Starting Key**: Center of range
- **Key Progression**: Ascending then Descending
- **Progression Count**: 5
- **Tempo**: 80-90 BPM

The 1.5 octave range extends both upward and downward.

## Effective Practice Steps

### Step 1: Warm Up (5 minutes)

1. Light lip trills through full range
2. Humming in mid-range
3. Light vowel sounds ("Ah", "Eh")

### Step 2: Stability Practice in Current Range (10 minutes)

Build accuracy within your comfortable range.

- **Scale**: Octave Repeat
- **Starting Key**: Center of comfortable range
- **Goal**: Pitch accuracy 80%+

### Step 3: Gently Exceed Boundaries (10 minutes)

Gradually extend beyond your comfort zone.

**Upward direction**:
- Raise starting key by one semitone
- Short attempts with Five Tone
- Return if it's too difficult

**Downward direction**:
- Lower starting key by one semitone
- Try with Five Tone Down
- Focus on breath support

### Step 4: Cool Down (5 minutes)

Always cool down after practice.

- Slow vocalization in mid-range
- Lip trills to relax throat
- Finish with deep breaths

## Tracking Progress

### Using Statistics

![Statistics screen](/images/en/05_statistics_pitch.png)

Record regularly to track your progress.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Pitch accuracy | Maintain 80%+ |
| Highest achieved | Record weekly |
| Lowest achieved | Record weekly |
| Comfortable range | Gradually expanding |

### Keeping Practice Records

1. **Record with same settings daily**
2. **Compare statistics weekly**
3. **Adjust settings when progress shows**
4. **Don't rush during plateaus**

## Tips by Range Direction

### When Extending High Range

- **Don't strain**: Keep throat open
- **Breath direction**: Imagine upward flow
- **Light production**: Rest when it feels heavy

### When Extending Low Range

- **Relax**: Keep throat loose
- **Breath support**: Support from core
- **Resonance**: Feel it in your chest

### Overcoming the Passaggio (Bridge)

The transition between chest and head voice requires practice.

**Practice method**:
1. Use Octave Long Tone near the passaggio
2. Practice smooth transitions
3. Develop mixed voice

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Voice Cracks on High Notes

**Cause**: Undeveloped passaggio, tension

**Solution**:
- Approach from below the break smoothly
- Practice short phrases with Five Tone
- Focus on relaxed production

### Voice Becomes Airy on Low Notes

**Cause**: Weak breath support, throat tension

**Solution**:
- Strengthen diaphragmatic breathing
- Practice slowly with Five Tone Down
- Focus on chest resonance

### Range Isn't Expanding

**Cause**: Rushing, insufficient practice

**Solution**:
- Progress by semitones
- Practice daily consistently
- Review every 1-2 weeks

## Summary

- First **accurately assess your current range**
- Practice upper and lower separately with **Five Tone** scales
- Extend gradually by **semitones**
- Track progress objectively with **statistics**
- **Consistent practice is most important** - don't rush
