## Quantifying "Slightly Off"

"A bit sharp." "Slightly flat." These are common feelings when singing.

"Cents" is the unit that precisely quantifies this "slightly."

## 1 Semitone = 100 Cents

A cent is 1/100th of a semitone.

| Unit | Relationship |
|------|--------------|
| 1 Octave | = 12 semitones = 1200 cents |
| 1 Semitone | = 100 cents |
| 1 Cent | = 1/100 semitone |

For example, "+30 cents" means you're 30/100 of a semitone (about 1/3 of a semitone) above the target.

## Why ±50 Cents?

The app displays cent deviation in the range of -50 to +50.

Below -50 cents, you're closer to the semitone below. Above +50 cents, you're closer to the semitone above. So the display stays within this range.

| Cents | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | Right on target |
| +50 | Halfway to the semitone above |
| -50 | Halfway to the semitone below |

## Why Use Cents?

### Matches Human Hearing

Saying "10Hz higher" doesn't tell you if that's a big or small deviation—it depends on the original pitch.

10Hz in a low range feels very different from 10Hz in a high range.

Cents are logarithmic, so "same cents = same perceived deviation" regardless of the pitch range.

### Musically Meaningful

Because it's based on semitones, cents are intuitive in a musical context.

"50 cents sharp" immediately means "halfway to the next semitone."

## Display in the App

Vocalis Studio shows cent deviation in real-time.

- **Green**: Close to target (roughly within ±10 cents)
- **Yellow**: Slightly off
- **Red**: Significantly off

The statistics also show "medianCents" and "averageDeviation" in cents.

## Practice Guidelines

What's a good target for cent deviation?

| Range | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Within ±10 cents | Very accurate |
| Within ±20 cents | Good |
| ±30 cents or more | Room for improvement |

These are just guidelines. Musicians sometimes intentionally vary pitch for expression.

## Summary

- A cent is 1/100th of a semitone
- 1 octave = 1200 cents
- Displayed in the ±50 cent range
- Represents the same "amount of deviation" across all pitch ranges
- Aim for within ±10 cents as a target
