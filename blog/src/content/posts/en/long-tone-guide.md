## What is Long Tone Practice?

Long tone practice involves sustaining a single note for an extended period.

It's effective for developing vocal stability, breath control, and vibrato.

## The Octave Long Tone Scale

Vocalis Studio includes a dedicated scale for this practice.

### Structure

**Octave Long Tone**: `Do→Mi→Sol→Do (4-beat hold)→Sol→Mi→Do`

The top Do is held for 4 beats. This extended hold is the key to long tone practice.

### Recommended Settings

| Setting | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
|---------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Tempo | 50-60 BPM | 60-80 BPM | 40-50 BPM |
| Starting Key | Comfortable mid-range | Slightly higher | Various ranges |
| Key Progression | Ascending only | Ascending then Descending | Ascending then Descending |
| Progression Count | 3-5 | 5-7 | 7-10 |

**Note**: Slower tempo means longer hold time and increased difficulty.

## Skills Developed by Long Tone Practice

### 1. Vocal Stability

Sustaining notes minimizes pitch wavering.

**What to Check**:
- Is the pitch line nearly horizontal?
- Is there minimal vertical movement?
- Does pitch drop as breath runs out?

### 2. Breath Control

Sustaining for 4 beats requires good breath management.

**Practice Tips**:
- Don't exhale too strongly at the start
- Maintain consistent airflow
- Keep breath stable until the end

### 3. Vibrato

Relaxed, extended tones encourage natural vibrato development.

**Development Process**:
1. First, achieve stable straight tone (no vibrato)
2. Wait for natural vibrato to emerge
3. Progress to conscious control

## Effective Practice Methods

### Step 1: Straight Tone

Start by aiming for a steady, vibrato-free tone.

**Settings**:
- Scale: Octave Long Tone
- Tempo: 60 BPM
- Goal: Keep pitch line horizontal

**Key Points**:
- Don't tense your throat
- Keep breath consistent
- Maintain volume until the end

### Step 2: Inducing Vibrato

Once you can produce stable straight tones, encourage natural vibrato.

**Settings**:
- Tempo: 50 BPM (even slower)
- Focus: Relax and let breath flow

**Tips**:
- Don't try to force vibrato
- Wait for it to happen naturally
- If you feel tension, go back to straight tone

### Step 3: Vibrato Control

When natural vibrato emerges, practice controlling it.

**Check Statistics**:
- **Rate**: Target 5-6 Hz
- **Extent**: 30-50 cents is natural
- **Regularity**: Aim for 60%+

## Practice by Range

### Low Range Long Tones

Focus on chest resonance for low notes.

**Settings**:
- Starting Key: Lower (MIDI 48-55 range)
- Tempo: 50-60 BPM
- Focus: Chest resonance

### Mid Range Long Tones

This is the most stable range for most singers.

**Settings**:
- Starting Key: Middle (MIDI 55-65 range)
- Tempo: 60-70 BPM
- Focus: Relaxed production

### High Range Long Tones

High notes are more challenging.

**Settings**:
- Starting Key: Higher (MIDI 65-72 range)
- Tempo: 70-80 BPM (slightly faster)
- Focus: Light production, no strain

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Pitch Drops

**Cause**: Weak breath support, fatigue

**Solution**:
- Strengthen diaphragmatic breathing
- Increase tempo for shorter holds
- Take breaks

### Pitch Rises

**Cause**: Tension, strain

**Solution**:
- Focus on relaxation
- Release neck and shoulder tension
- Exhale slowly

### Vibrato Too Fast

**Cause**: Throat tension

**Solution**:
- Return to straight tone
- Retry in a relaxed state
- Slow the tempo

### Irregular Vibrato

**Cause**: Still developing

**Solution**:
- Continue consistent practice
- Practice with a metronome
- Be patient

## Sample Practice Schedule

### Daily Practice (15 minutes)

1. **Warm Up**: 5 minutes
   - Lip trills, humming

2. **Straight Tone**: 5 minutes
   - Octave Long Tone, tempo 60

3. **Vibrato Practice**: 5 minutes
   - Octave Long Tone, tempo 50

### Intensive Practice (30 minutes)

1. **Warm Up**: 5 minutes

2. **Low Range**: 8 minutes
   - Straight → Vibrato

3. **Mid Range**: 8 minutes
   - Straight → Vibrato

4. **High Range**: 7 minutes
   - Focus on straight tone

5. **Cool Down**: 2 minutes

## Tracking Progress

### Weekly Checkpoints

| Metric | Initial Goal | Mid-term Goal | Long-term Goal |
|--------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Straight stability | 2-beat hold | 4-beat hold | 8-beat hold |
| Vibrato rate | Present | 5-7 Hz | 5-6 Hz |
| Vibrato regularity | 40%+ | 60%+ | 80%+ |

### How to Track

1. Record once weekly with same settings
2. Note statistics
3. Screenshot pitch graph
4. Compare changes over time

## Summary

- **Octave Long Tone** is ideal for long tone practice
- First aim for stable **straight tone**
- Let **vibrato** develop naturally
- Track progress objectively with **statistics**
- Decrease tempo to increase difficulty
