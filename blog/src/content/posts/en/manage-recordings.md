## Introduction

After recording your voice, you will want to review your progress and keep your recordings organized. Vocalis Studio provides tools to help you manage your growing collection of recordings.

The recording list gives you quick access to playback, sorting, filtering, and analysis features. In this guide, I will explain how to use these tools effectively.

## Summary

Managing recordings in Vocalis Studio involves:

1. Accessing the recording list from the home screen
2. Using playback controls to review recordings
3. Sorting and filtering to find specific recordings
4. Renaming recordings for better organization
5. Deleting recordings you no longer need

## Accessing Your Recordings

From the home screen, tap "Recording List" to view all your saved recordings. Each entry shows:

- Recording title
- Creation date and time
- Duration
- Scale type used (if any)

## Playback Controls

The recording list includes playback controls for quick review:

| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Play/Pause | Start or pause playback |
| Previous | Go to the previous recording |
| Next | Go to the next recording |

You can listen to recordings directly from the list without opening the full analysis screen.

## Sorting Options

Vocalis Studio offers 6 sorting options to organize your recordings:

| Sort Option | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Created (Newest) | Most recent recordings first (default) |
| Created (Oldest) | Oldest recordings first |
| Title (A-Z) | Alphabetical order |
| Title (Z-A) | Reverse alphabetical order |
| Duration (Shortest) | Shortest recordings first |
| Duration (Longest) | Longest recordings first |

Tap the sort button to change the current sorting method. The default is "Created (Newest)" which shows your most recent recordings at the top.

## Filtering Recordings

When you have many recordings, filters help you find specific ones quickly.

### Date Filter

| Filter | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| All | All recordings |
| Today | Recordings from today |
| This Week | Recordings from this week |
| This Month | Recordings from this month |

### Scale Type Filter

Filter by the scale pattern used during recording:

- All (no filter)
- Five Tone
- Five Tone Down
- Rossini Scale
- Octave Repeat
- Octave Long Tone
- Broken Scale
- Broken Scale Double
- Arpeggio Down Triple
- Free Recording (no scale)

### Pitch Range Filter

Set minimum and maximum pitch values to find recordings within a specific vocal range:

- Minimum: C2 (MIDI note 36)
- Maximum: C6 (MIDI note 84)

### Tempo Range Filter

Filter by tempo setting:

- Minimum: 30 BPM
- Maximum: 240 BPM

### Text Search

Type keywords to search recording titles and settings. This is useful when you have named recordings with specific identifiers.

## Renaming Recordings

Give your recordings meaningful names to make them easier to find:

1. Find the recording you want to rename
2. Tap the edit option
3. Enter a new name
4. Confirm the change

Consider using descriptive names like "Warm-up Five Tone C4" or "High Range Practice" to quickly identify recordings later.

## Deleting Recordings

To remove recordings you no longer need:

1. Select the recording to delete
2. Tap the delete option
3. Confirm deletion in the dialog

Note that deleted recordings cannot be recovered. The app asks for confirmation before deleting to prevent accidental data loss.

## Going to Analysis

From any recording in the list, you can open the full analysis screen to see:

- Pitch graph showing your performance over time
- Spectrogram view of frequency content
- Detailed statistics about accuracy and stability

The analysis screen provides deeper insights into each recording. See the pitch graph guide for more information about interpreting your analysis results.

## Common Questions

### Q: How many recordings can I save?

Recordings are saved locally on your device. The limit depends on your device's available storage. Each recording uses minimal space, so you can typically save hundreds of recordings.

### Q: Can I export my recordings?

Currently, recordings are stored locally within the app. Export functionality may be available in future updates.

### Q: Why can I not find a recording?

Check your filter settings. If filters are active, some recordings may be hidden. Reset all filters to "All" to see your complete recording list.

### Q: What happens if I delete the app?

Deleting the app removes all stored recordings. Make sure to review any recordings you want to analyze before uninstalling.

## Summary

- Access recordings from the home screen
- Use playback controls for quick review
- Sort by date, title, or duration
- Filter by date, scale type, pitch range, or tempo
- Rename recordings for better organization
- Delete unwanted recordings (with confirmation)
- Open analysis screen for detailed insights

With these management tools, you can keep your recordings organized and easily track your progress over time.
