## What is Vibrato?

Vibrato is a singing technique that creates periodic pitch oscillation.

Proper vibrato adds richness and expression to your voice. Vocalis Studio analyzes vibrato using three metrics.

## Three Analysis Metrics

### Rate

Measures how **fast** the vibrato oscillates. Unit: Hz (oscillations per second).

| Value | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| 4-5 Hz | Relaxed feel |
| 5-6 Hz | Common range |
| 6-7 Hz | Somewhat fast |
| 7+ Hz | Fast (possibly tense) |

**Target**: 5-6 Hz is considered pleasant in most genres.

### Extent

Measures the **width** of the vibrato. Unit: cents.

| Value | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| 15-30 cents | Subtle |
| 30-50 cents | Standard |
| 50-80 cents | Wide |
| 80+ cents | Very wide |

**Target**: 30-50 cents sounds natural to most listeners.

### Regularity

Measures the **stability** of the vibrato. Shown as percentage.

| Value | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| 80%+ | Very stable |
| 60-80% | Good |
| 40-60% | Room for improvement |
| Below 40% | Unstable |

**Target**: Aim for 60% or higher.

## Checking in Statistics

- **Average Rate**: Overall average speed of vibrato
- **Average Extent**: Overall average width of vibrato
- **Average Regularity**: Overall stability of vibrato

## Common Patterns and Improvements

### Rate Too Fast (7Hz+)

**Cause**: Throat tension, nervousness

**How to Improve**:
- Sing in a relaxed state
- Practice with slower songs
- Focus on diaphragmatic breathing

### Rate Too Slow (Below 4Hz)

**Cause**: Weak breath support, trying too hard

**How to Improve**:
- Practice sustaining notes naturally
- Don't force vibrato—let it happen naturally

### Extent Too Narrow

**Cause**: Tension, throat stiffness

**How to Improve**:
- Use Octave Long Tone scale for sustained practice
- Relax and let breath flow freely

### Extent Too Wide

**Cause**: Lack of control, overdoing it

**How to Improve**:
- Practice straight tone (no vibrato)
- Work on consciously controlling the width

### Low Regularity

**Cause**: Vibrato not yet stable

**How to Improve**:
- Practice oscillating at a steady tempo
- Use a metronome for vibrato exercises

## Tips for Vibrato Practice

### Use Octave Long Tone

This scale holds the top note for 4 beats. Sustaining notes longer helps natural vibrato emerge.

### Start Straight

Don't try to add vibrato—start by sustaining straight tones. Once your vocalization is stable, vibrato will naturally appear.

### Record and Review

Objectively reviewing your vibrato is essential. Check your statistics to identify areas for improvement.

## Tendencies by Genre

| Genre | Rate | Extent |
|-------|------|--------|
| Classical | 5-6 Hz | Wide (50-80 cents) |
| Pop | 5-7 Hz | Standard (30-50 cents) |
| Jazz | Varies | Changes with expression |
| Rock | Faster | Subtle to standard |

What makes "good vibrato" differs by genre. Practice according to the style you're aiming for.

## Summary

- **Rate**: 5-6 Hz is the general target
- **Extent**: 30-50 cents sounds natural
- **Regularity**: Aim for 60%+
- Don't force it—relaxation is fundamental
- Octave Long Tone scale is effective for practice
