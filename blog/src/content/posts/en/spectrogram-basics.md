## Voice Has "Color"

Even at the same pitch, voices sound different from person to person. Bright, dark, resonant, muffled.

These differences come from the balance of frequency components in the voice. A spectrogram visualizes this balance.

## What a Spectrogram Shows

You can see how the frequency components of your voice change over time in a single image.

- Which frequency bands are strong
- How they change over time
- Differences between vowels

If the pitch graph shows "pitch," the spectrogram shows "tonal quality."

## How to Read It

Select the "Spectrogram" tab in the analysis screen.

### Three Axes

| Axis | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Horizontal | Time (progresses left to right) |
| Vertical | Frequency (low at bottom, high at top) |
| Color | Amplitude (intensity). Brighter means stronger |

### Frequency Range

The app displays 100Hz to 2500Hz. This range captures the essential characteristics of the human voice.

The vertical axis uses a logarithmic scale, making lower frequencies easier to see.

## Understanding Voice Components

### Harmonics

When you vocalize, not only the fundamental frequency but also its integer multiples (harmonics) sound simultaneously.

On a spectrogram, these appear as multiple horizontal lines. The balance of these lines determines the "color" of your voice.

### Formants

When pronouncing vowels, specific frequency bands are emphasized. These are called formants.

For example, "ah" and "ee" emphasize different frequency bands. On the spectrogram, you can see the bright areas shift depending on the vowel.

## Navigation

You can navigate the spectrogram with touch gestures.

- **Horizontal swipe**: Scroll through time
- **Vertical swipe**: Scroll through frequencies

Like the pitch graph, you can scroll in both directions to find the area you want to examine.

## Tips for Using the Spectrogram

### Switch Between Pitch Graph and Spectrogram

Viewing the same recording with both the pitch graph and spectrogram lets you analyze both pitch accuracy and voice quality.

### Observe Vowel Differences

Record yourself singing the same note with different vowels and compare them. You'll visually see the formant differences.

### Check the Statistics Too

The statistics section includes metrics for high-frequency components. Use them alongside the spectrogram for both visual and numerical analysis.

## Summary

- A spectrogram visualizes the frequency components of your voice
- Horizontal axis is time, vertical is frequency, color is intensity
- Shows harmonics and formant characteristics
- Use with the pitch graph for comprehensive analysis

Next time, we'll cover how to read the statistics.
