## Measuring How Your Voice "Carries"

Some voices cut through an orchestra. Others fill a room without amplification.

What these voices have in common is a specific balance of high-frequency components. Vocalis Studio measures this balance through three distinct metrics.

## Key Takeaways

| Metric | Frequency Range | What It Reveals |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Singer's Formant (SF) | 2.5-3.5 kHz | Vocal projection |
| Brightness | 4-6 kHz | Vocal clarity |
| Airiness | 6-9 kHz | Breath component |

These aren't "good" or "bad" values—they help you objectively understand your voice's characteristics.

## What Is Singer's Formant?

### The 2.5-3.5 kHz Resonance

Singer's Formant refers to a concentration of acoustic energy in the 2.5-3.5 kHz range, characteristic of trained classical singers.

When this range is pronounced, your voice contains frequencies above the orchestral range (mainly 500Hz-2kHz), helping it project over accompaniment.

### What High Values Mean

- Voice tends to "carry" or sound "focused"
- Better projection in large venues
- Associated with classical vocal technique

### About Low Values

Low values aren't necessarily problematic. Pop and jazz singers often don't emphasize this frequency range.

The appropriate value depends on your genre and target vocal quality.

## What Is Brightness?

### The 4-6 kHz Clarity

Brightness relates to vocal "clarity" and "presence."

It affects consonant clarity and how defined your voice sounds.

### What High Values Mean

- Clear pronunciation
- Voice sounds "crisp" or "present"
- Generally good microphone response

### What Low Values Mean

- Soft, mellow tone
- May sound "covered" in some contexts
- Can suit ballads or gentle expressions

## What Is Airiness?

### The 6-9 kHz Breath Component

Airiness measures the "breath" component in your voice.

Whisper singing or breathy delivery increases this value.

### What High Values Mean

- Breathy, soft vocal quality
- Creates intimacy
- Common in pop and R&B styles

### What Low Values Mean

- Full vocal fold closure
- Powerful impression
- Common in classical and rock styles

## Viewing in Statistics Screen

After playing a recording, open the statistics screen to find the "Spectrum Analysis" section with all three metrics.

### Understanding the Values

Each metric shows relative strength, averaged across your entire recording. This reveals overall tendencies rather than momentary changes.

### Comparison Tips

Record the same song or scale with different techniques, then compare:

- Breathy delivery vs. full voice
- Wide mouth opening vs. minimal opening
- Relaxed state vs. tense state

## Practical Applications

### Improving Projection

To develop Singer's Formant:

- Practice with an open throat
- Focus on "ng" resonance
- Use Five-Tone Scale for fundamentals

### Improving Clarity

To increase Brightness:

- Articulate consonants clearly
- Be mindful of mouth shape
- Imagine projecting voice forward

### Adjusting Breathiness

To control Airiness:

- Be aware of vocal fold closure
- Record with varying breath levels
- Match technique to song expression

## Balancing All Three Metrics

These metrics aren't independent—they shift together based on your technique.

### Common Patterns

| Vocal Style | SF | Brightness | Airiness |
|-------------|-----|------------|----------|
| Classical | High | Medium-High | Low |
| Pop (Power) | Medium | High | Low |
| Pop (Whisper) | Low | Medium | High |
| Jazz | Varies | Medium | Medium-High |

Through repeated recordings, identify which pattern your voice follows.

## Using with Spectrogram

Beyond statistics, the spectrogram view deepens understanding.

In the spectrogram, you can visually identify where high-frequency content appears brighter. This reveals how specific phrases affect your high-frequency output over time.

## Summary

- **Singer's Formant (2.5-3.5 kHz)**: Vocal projection. Higher in classical technique
- **Brightness (4-6 kHz)**: Vocal clarity. Relates to consonant definition
- **Airiness (6-9 kHz)**: Breath component. Higher in breathy styles
- Use these to match your target vocal quality, not as absolute goals
- Compare multiple recordings under same conditions for best insights

Use these metrics to objectively understand your voice's unique characteristics.
