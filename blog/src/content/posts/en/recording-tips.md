## What Makes a Good Recording

Pitch detection accuracy depends heavily on recording quality.

Too much noise or too low a volume makes accurate analysis difficult. A few simple adjustments can significantly improve detection accuracy.

## Environment and Microphone Position Matter

You don't need special equipment—just optimizing your environment can improve recording quality.

## Microphone Distance

When using your iPhone or iPad's built-in microphone, distance is key.

### Too Close

If the microphone is too close to your mouth, breath noise becomes prominent. Plosives ("p", "t" sounds) can also overload the microphone.

### Too Far

If you're too far away, your voice becomes quiet and environmental sounds have more influence. This reduces pitch detection accuracy.

### Recommended Distance

About 20-30cm (8-12 inches) is a good guideline. Think about one to two palm-widths away.

## Reducing Environmental Noise

### Choose a Quiet Location

Air conditioning, traffic, appliance noise—many sounds can affect your recording. Record in as quiet a place as possible.

### Rooms with Less Reverb

Large rooms or rooms with hard walls create more echo. Curtains and fabric help reduce reverb.

A closet—small and surrounded by clothes—can actually be a great recording spot.

### Use Earphones

Scale sounds from speakers can interfere with pitch detection. Using earphones ensures only your voice is recorded.

## Adjusting Detection Sensitivity

You can adjust pitch detection sensitivity in the settings.

| Setting | Characteristics | Best For |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Low | Noise resistant | Noisy environments |
| Normal | Balanced | General use |
| High | Detects quiet sounds | Quiet environments, soft singing |

Adjust according to your environment. Use "Low" in noisy conditions, "High" when practicing quietly in a silent space.

## Other Tips

### Keep Volume Consistent

Extremely loud or soft voices can cause unstable detection. Record at your normal singing volume.

### Warm Up First

Your pitch tends to be unstable when your voice isn't warmed up. Light humming before recording leads to more accurate analysis.

## Summary

- Aim for 20-30cm microphone distance
- Choose a quiet location with minimal reverb
- Use earphones to prevent scale sound interference
- Adjust detection sensitivity for your environment
- Keep volume consistent and warm up before recording
