## What is Key Progression?

Key progression automatically changes the key (pitch) after each scale, continuing to the next scale.

For example, starting from C4 and going up by half steps: C4 → C#4 → D4 → D#4...

This lets you efficiently practice multiple keys in a single recording session.

## 4 Progression Patterns

### Ascending Only

The key only goes up.

**Example**: C4 → C#4 → D4 → D#4 (with 3 ascending steps)

Perfect for gradually extending your high range.

### Descending Only

The key only goes down.

**Example**: C4 → B3 → Bb3 → A3 (with 3 descending steps)

Great for low range development and relaxed vocalization practice.

### Ascending Then Descending

Goes up first, then comes back down from the highest point. **This is the default setting.**

**Example**: C4 → C#4 → D4 → D#4 → D4 → C#4 → C4

Ideal for warm-ups. Gradually challenge your high range, then cool down on the way back.

### Descending Then Ascending

Goes down first, then comes back up from the lowest point.

**Example**: C4 → B3 → Bb3 → A3 → Bb3 → B3 → C4

For when you want to start from lower notes or add variety to your practice.

## Key Change Settings

### Ascending/Descending Count

Each can be set from 0 to 24.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Ascending Count | 3 | Number of times to raise the key |
| Descending Count | 0 | Number of times to lower the key |

With the default "Ascending Then Descending" pattern and 3 ascending steps, you'll perform 7 scales total (C→C#→D→D#→D→C#→C).

### Step Interval

Sets how many semitones to change with each step.

| Interval | Description | Example (ascending from C4) |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| 1 (half step) | Default | C4 → C#4 → D4 |
| 2 (whole step) | 2 semitones | C4 → D4 → E4 |
| 3 (minor 3rd) | 3 semitones | C4 → D#4 → F#4 |
| 12 (octave) | 1 octave | C4 → C5 → C6 |

## Practical Setting Examples

### For Beginners: Gentle Ascending

- **Pattern**: Ascending Only
- **Ascending Count**: 2-3
- **Step**: 1 (half step)

Perfect for gradually getting used to higher notes without strain.

### Warm-up: Round Trip

- **Pattern**: Ascending Then Descending
- **Ascending Count**: 3
- **Step**: 1 (half step)

The default setting works great. Perfect for starting your daily practice.

### Range Extension: Wide Coverage

- **Pattern**: Ascending Only
- **Ascending Count**: 6-8
- **Step**: 1 (half step)

Challenge your high range limits. Increase the count to see how high you can go.

### Efficient Practice: Larger Steps

- **Pattern**: Ascending Then Descending
- **Ascending Count**: 4
- **Step**: 2 (whole step)

Moving by whole steps saves time while covering a wider range.

### Low Range Development

- **Pattern**: Descending Only
- **Descending Count**: 4
- **Step**: 1 (half step)

For expanding your low range. Pairs well with the Five Tone Down scale.

## Choosing Starting Pitch

Your starting pitch is just as important as key progression settings.

| Voice Type (approx.) | Starting Pitch | Suggested Ascending Count |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Low (Bass-Baritone) | A2-C3 | 4-6 |
| Medium (Tenor-Alto) | C3-E3 | 3-5 |
| High (Mezzo-Soprano) | E3-G3 | 3-4 |

The basic approach: start from a comfortable low note and use ascending to challenge your high range.

## Tips for Using Key Progression

### Don't Overdo It

If your voice gives out on high notes, reduce the ascending count or lower your starting pitch next time.

### Track Your Top Notes

Noting "I reached D5 today" helps you see your progress over time.

### Combine with Scale Types

- **Five Tone + Ascending Then Descending**: Basic warm-up
- **Octave Long Tone + Ascending Only**: High note stability
- **Rossini Scale + Ascending Only**: Advanced range extension

## Summary

- **Ascending Then Descending** pattern is ideal for warm-ups
- Control practice length and range with **ascending count**
- Adjust efficiency and detail with **step interval**
- Start from a comfortable low pitch
- Combine with scale types for effective practice
