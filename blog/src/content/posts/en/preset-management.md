## What Are Presets?

Manually configuring the same scale settings every time is tedious.

With presets, you can save your favorite settings and recall them with a single tap.

## What Gets Saved in a Preset

Presets store all of these settings:

| Setting | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Scale Type | Five Tone, Rossini Scale, etc. |
| Starting Pitch | C4, G3, etc. |
| Tempo | 1.0 sec, 1.5 sec, etc. |
| Key Progression Pattern | Ascending Then Descending, Ascending Only, etc. |
| Ascending Count | 3, 5, etc. |
| Descending Count | 0, 2, etc. |
| Ascending Step | 1 semitone, 2 semitones, etc. |
| Descending Step | 1 semitone, 2 semitones, etc. |

## How to Save a Preset

1. Configure your desired settings on the recording screen
2. Tap the "Save Preset" button in the settings panel
3. Enter a name and save

Choose a descriptive name to find it easily later.

## How to Load a Preset

1. Tap "Presets" in the recording screen settings panel
2. Select the preset you want to use
3. Settings are applied automatically

## Preset List Features

### Sorting Options

Presets can be sorted in three ways:

| Sort | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Last Updated | Most recently used at top (default) |
| Name | Alphabetical order |
| Pitch | By starting pitch (low to high) |

### Edit and Delete

You can edit or delete any preset from the preset list.

## Recommended Preset Examples

### For Warm-ups

- **Name**: "Morning Warm-up"
- **Scale**: Five Tone
- **Starting Pitch**: A comfortable low note (e.g., C3)
- **Key Progression**: Ascending Then Descending
- **Ascending Count**: 3

### For High Note Training

- **Name**: "High Range Training"
- **Scale**: Octave Repeat
- **Starting Pitch**: Mid-range note (e.g., E3)
- **Key Progression**: Ascending Only
- **Ascending Count**: 5-6

### For Low Range Development

- **Name**: "Low Range Exercise"

## Tips for Using Presets

### Create a Practice Routine

Use multiple presets in sequence to build a complete practice routine:

1. "Morning Warm-up" to get your voice ready
2. "High Range Training" to develop upper notes
3. "Low Range Exercise" to maintain lower notes

### Adjust Based on Daily Condition

If high notes feel difficult today, create a new preset with fewer ascending steps. Adjust presets as your voice changes and improves.

### Use Descriptive Names

Instead of "C3 Start", try "Morning Warm-up Light" - names that describe the purpose are more helpful.

## Summary

- Presets eliminate repetitive setup work
- Scale type, pitch, key progression - everything is saved
- Create purpose-specific presets to boost practice efficiency
- Use clear, descriptive names for easy management
- Combine multiple presets to build complete practice routines
