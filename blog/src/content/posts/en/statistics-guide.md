## Singing in Numbers

While the pitch graph and spectrogram are great for visual confirmation, numbers help you objectively understand "how accurate" you were.

The statistics sheet shows your recording analysis results as numerical data.

## What Statistics Show

- Pitch accuracy (overall and per note)
- Sharp/flat tendencies
- Pitch stability
- Vibrato characteristics
- High-frequency voice components (Premium)

## Pitch Analysis Section

### Overall

| Item | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| accuracy | Overall accuracy (%). How close you were to target pitches |
| medianCents | Median cent deviation. Whether you tend sharp or flat overall |
| range | Pitch range. The span of notes you sang |

Higher accuracy means you sang closer to the target pitches.

### Position

| Item | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| inTuneRate | In-tune rate (%). Percentage of time within target pitch |
| sharpRate | Sharp rate (%). Percentage of time singing sharp |
| flatRate | Flat rate (%). Percentage of time singing flat |
| averageDeviation | Average deviation (cents). Average amount of pitch deviation |

This helps you understand whether you tend to sing sharp or flat.

### Pitch (Detailed)

| Item | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| noteOnsetAccuracyScore | Note onset accuracy. How accurately you hit each note's beginning |
| pitchStabilityScore | Pitch stability. How steady you hold notes |
| intervalAccuracyScore | Interval accuracy. How accurately you move between notes |

These scores help identify which aspects need improvement.

## Vibrato Analysis

The app detects vibrato sections and quantifies their characteristics.

| Item | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| averageRate | Average rate (Hz). Speed of the vibrato |
| averageExtent | Average extent (cents). Width of the vibrato oscillation |
| averageRegularity | Average regularity (%). Consistency of the vibrato |

Generally, natural vibrato has a rate around 5-7 Hz and is regular.

## Spectrum Analysis (Premium)

Analyzes high-frequency characteristics of your voice. This feature is for Premium members.

![Statistics (Spectrum Analysis)](/web/blog/images/en/05_statistics_spectrum.png)

| Item | Frequency Range | Meaning |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Singer's Formant (SF) | 2.5-3.5 kHz | Related to voice projection |
| Brightness | 4-6 kHz | Related to voice clarity |
| Airiness | 6-9 kHz | Related to breathiness |

These are reference metrics for objectively understanding voice quality characteristics.

## Tips for Using Statistics

### Identify Trends

Compare multiple recordings rather than just one to see your patterns. You might discover things like "I always tend flat" or "I get unstable on high notes."

### Focus on One Thing

Don't try to improve everything at once. If "note onset" is your challenge, focus your practice there first.

### Combine with Graphs

Use statistics to understand trends, then use the pitch graph to find specific moments. This combination makes for efficient review.

## Summary

- Statistics provide objective numerical evaluation of your singing
- Pitch analysis shows accuracy, stability, and tendencies
- Vibrato analysis quantifies vibrato characteristics
- Spectrum analysis (Premium) reveals voice quality features
- Compare multiple recordings to identify your patterns
