## Introduction

Scale practice is one of the most effective ways to develop pitch accuracy. By singing along with reference tones, you can train your ear and voice to hit the right notes consistently.

Vocalis Studio provides various scale patterns designed for vocal training. Each pattern serves a different purpose, from basic warm-ups to advanced exercises.

In this guide, I will explain how to set up and use scale practice mode.

## Summary

Scale practice in Vocalis Studio works like this:

1. Choose a scale pattern (9 types available)
2. Set your starting pitch (C3 to C6)
3. Adjust the tempo if needed
4. Record while following the reference tones

## Understanding Scale Types

Vocalis Studio offers 9 scale patterns:

| Scale Type | Description | Best For |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Five Tone | Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-Fa-Mi-Re-Do | Basic warm-up, beginners |
| Five Tone Down | So-Fa-Mi-Re-Do (descending) | Descending practice |
| Octave Repeat | Climb to octave, repeat top note | Sustaining high notes |
| Octave Long Tone | Hold the octave for 4 beats | Breath control |
| Broken Scale | 1-5-3-8-5-3-1 pattern | Interval jumps |
| Broken Scale Double | Above pattern repeated twice | Extended practice |
| Rossini Scale | 1.5 octave ascending scale | Range extension |
| Arpeggio Down Triple | 16-note descending arpeggio | Advanced agility |

For beginners, I recommend starting with **Five Tone**. It covers a comfortable range and follows a familiar pattern.

## Setting Up Your Practice

### Starting Pitch

The starting pitch determines where your scale begins. You can set it anywhere from C3 to C6 (MIDI notes 48-84).

Tips for choosing your starting pitch:

- **Start in your comfortable range**: Choose a pitch where you can sing easily
- **Adjust based on the scale**: Higher scales need a lower starting pitch
- **Consider the scale's range**: Five Tone spans 7 semitones from the start

### Tempo

Tempo controls how long each note is held. The range is 1.0 to 3.0 seconds per note.

- **1.0 second**: Standard tempo, good for most practice
- **2.0+ seconds**: Slower pace, useful for breath control and sustained tones
- **Faster than 1.0**: Not available, as accurate pitch requires time to settle

### Key Progression

Key progression determines how the scale moves through different keys:

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Ascending Only | Move up by semitones |
| Descending Only | Move down by semitones |
| Ascending Then Descending | Go up, then come back down |
| Descending Then Ascending | Go down, then come back up |

You can also set:

- **Ascending Key Count**: How many keys to move up (0-24)
- **Descending Key Count**: How many keys to move down (0-24)
- **Step Interval**: How many semitones per step (1-12)

## During Practice

When you start recording with a scale:

1. **Chord introduction**: You hear a chord to establish the key
2. **Scale playback**: Reference tones play one by one
3. **Real-time feedback**: The app shows your pitch against the target

The indicator display shows:

- **Target note**: The note you should be singing
- **Detected note**: What the app hears from you
- **Cent deviation**: How far off you are (±50 cents)

## Saving Presets

If you find settings that work well for you, save them as a preset:

1. Configure your preferred settings
2. Tap the save preset button
3. Give your preset a name

You can manage presets from the preset list, including renaming and deleting.

## Common Questions

### Q: Which scale should I start with?

Five Tone is ideal for beginners. It covers a comfortable range and the pattern is intuitive.

### Q: How do I know if I am singing in tune?

Watch the indicator display. When your detected pitch matches the target, the display will show minimal cent deviation (close to 0).

### Q: Can I practice without the reference tones?

Yes, set the scale type to "Off" for free recording. However, using reference tones helps train your pitch memory.

## Summary

- Scale practice provides guided pitch training
- Start with Five Tone for a comfortable introduction
- Adjust starting pitch to match your vocal range
- Use slower tempos for breath control practice
- Save your favorite settings as presets

The next guide will cover how to review and manage your recordings.
