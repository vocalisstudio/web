## Introduction

Recording your voice is the first step toward understanding and improving your singing. Vocalis Studio makes this process simple and straightforward.

As the developer of this app, I designed the recording flow to be as intuitive as possible. You can start recording within seconds of opening the app.

In this guide, I will walk you through the basic recording process.

## Summary

Making your first recording takes just three steps:

1. Tap "Start Recording" on the home screen
2. Set the scale type to "Off" for free recording
3. Tap the record button to start, and tap again to stop

## Basic Steps

### Step 1: Open the Recording Screen

From the home screen, tap the "Start Recording" button. This takes you to the recording screen where you can configure your recording settings.

### Step 2: Configure Settings (Optional)

For your first recording, I recommend keeping things simple:

- **Scale Type**: Set to "Off" for free recording without a reference scale
- **Other Settings**: You can leave these at their defaults for now

The settings panel is on the left side in landscape mode, or can be toggled in portrait mode.

### Step 3: Start Recording

Tap the red record button to begin. A brief countdown will appear, then recording starts automatically.

While recording, you will see:

- **Real-time waveform**: Visual representation of your voice
- **Audio level meter**: Shows your current volume
- **Pitch detection**: Displays the detected pitch in real-time

When you are finished, tap the stop button. Your recording is automatically saved.

## What Happens After Recording

Once you stop recording, you have several options:

- **Play Last Recording**: Listen to what you just recorded
- **Go to Analysis**: View detailed pitch analysis and statistics
- **Start New Recording**: Begin another recording session

The analysis screen provides valuable insights into your pitch accuracy and vocal characteristics.

## Common Questions

### Q: How long can I record?

Free users can record up to 30 seconds per session, with 5 recordings per day. Premium subscribers have extended limits.

### Q: Where are my recordings saved?

All recordings are saved locally on your device. You can access them from the "Recording List" on the home screen.

### Q: Do I need headphones?

Headphones are recommended but not required. Using headphones can improve pitch detection accuracy by preventing feedback from the speaker.

## Summary

- Recording is simple: just tap and sing
- Start with "Scale Off" mode for free recording
- Real-time feedback helps you monitor your voice
- Recordings are saved automatically for later review

In the next guide, we will explore how to use scale practice mode to improve your pitch accuracy.
