🎤 Vocalis Studio Usage Guide 3

【Key Ascending/Descending Settings】

Fine-tune the range of your scale practice:

🔼 Key Ascending
・Count: Set how many steps up from the start pitch
・Interval: Choose half step or whole step

🔽 Key Descending
・Count: Set how many steps down
・Interval: Choose half step or whole step

Example: Ascending by half steps 5 times from C3:
C3 → C#3 → D3 → D#3 → E3 → F3

Ideal for vocal range checks and range expansion exercises.
