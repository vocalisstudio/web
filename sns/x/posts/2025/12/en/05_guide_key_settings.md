【Key Ascending/Descending Settings】

Fine-tune the range of your scale practice:

🔼 Key Ascending
・Count: number of steps up
・Interval: half step or whole step

🔽 Key Descending
・Count: number of steps down
・Interval: half step or whole step

Ideal for vocal range checks and range expansion exercises.
